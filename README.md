# Linux-Encryption-Decryption-Project
Linux Project Description
objective: this project is designed to teach you how encryption and decryption work using real Linux commands.
I will encrypt a file, verify it is unreadable, then decrypt it back to its original form.
This project uses tools that already exist on Linux systems.



PART 1: CREATE A PLAINTEXT FILE


STEP 1: OPEN YOUR TERMINAL 

STEP 2: CREATE A NEW FILE CALLED message.txt using echo command:

echo "Encryption hides data but does not make system secure." > messsage.txt
